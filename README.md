**AIDED** is a comprehensive software development methodology that leverages artificial intelligence capabilities in every phase of the project lifecycle. This framework provides a structured and scalable approach for building modern applications, optimizing collaboration between developers and AI.

## 🚀 What is AIDED?

Unlike traditional methodologies like Agile or Scrum, AIDED is specifically designed to maximize the efficiency and quality of AI-assisted development, establishing clear processes for documentation, architecture, and continuous deployment.

The goal is to reduce development time, increase code quality, and allow for efficient scalability while maintaining full control of the project.

## 📚 Documentation

The complete framework documentation is available at:

- [Framework Documentation (Markdown)](./AIDED_Framework_Documentation_EN.md)
- [Documentation Site (Next.js)](./aided-docs/)

## 🛠️ Framework Phases

The framework is divided into 7 key phases:

| Phase | Description | Main Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 0: Conceptualization** | AI-assisted architecture and product definition. | Mermaid, ChatGPT/Claude |
| **Phase 1: Management** | Documentation centralization and source of truth. | ClickUp / Notion |
| **Phase 2: Backend** | Data infrastructure and security. | Supabase |
| **Phase 3: Frontend** | Project initialization and structure. | Next.js, React |
| **Phase 4: UX/UI Design** | Assisted visual design flows. | Figma, v0.dev |
| **Phase 5: Development** | Evolutionary implementation with AI Agents. | AI Agents (Cursor/Trae) |
| **Phase 6: Testing & CI/CD** | Automation and quality assurance. | GitHub Actions, Jest |

## 🏁 Getting Started

To start using the AIDED framework in your next project:

1. **Read the Core Principles**: Understand how to collaborate with AI.
2. **Follow Phase 0**: Define your architecture before writing code.
3. **Set up your environment**: Prepare your AI tools and IDE.

Check the [Getting Started Guide](./AIDED_Framework_Documentation_EN.md#📍-starting-points) for more details.
