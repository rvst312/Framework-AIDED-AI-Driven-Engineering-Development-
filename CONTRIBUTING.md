# Contributing to the AIDED Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AIDED! Community contributions are essential to keep this framework updated and useful for everyone.

## How can I contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs
If you find an error or something that doesn't work as it should in the documentation or guides:
- Search existing [Issues](https://github.com/tu-usuario/AIDED/issues) to see if it has already been reported.
- If it doesn't exist, create a new Issue describing the problem in detail.

### 2. Suggesting Improvements
If you have ideas to improve a framework phase or add new tools:
- Open an Issue with the `enhancement` label.
- Describe your proposal and why it would be beneficial for the community.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-improvement`).
3. Make your changes. Ensure you follow the existing documentation style.
4. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add new guide for Phase X'`).
5. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-improvement`).
6. Open a **Pull Request**.

## Documentation Style

- Use standard Markdown.
- Maintain a professional but accessible tone.
- If you add diagrams, use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/).
- Check spelling and grammar.

## Documentation Site Development (`aided-docs`)

If you are contributing to the documentation website:
1. Navigate to the directory: `cd aided-docs`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`

We look forward to your contributions!
