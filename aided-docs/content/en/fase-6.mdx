### **PHASE 6: Testing, CI/CD and Deployment**

**Objective**: Establish automated deployment pipeline with guaranteed quality.

#### **Testing Configuration**
1. **Unit Testing with Jest**: Critical components and utilities.
2. **Integration Testing**: Authentication flows and forms.
3. **E2E Testing with Playwright (Optional)**: Complete user flows.

#### **CI/CD Configuration**
1. **GitHub Actions**: `CI` pipeline (test, lint, build) and `Deploy to Staging`.
2. **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit (lint-staged).
3. **Scripts**: `npm run test:ci`, `npm run format`.

#### **Deployment Strategy**
**Vercel (Recommended)**
* **Production**: `main` branch -> `app.yourdomain.com`.
* **Preview**: `dev` branch -> `staging.yourdomain.com`.

**Alternative: VPS with Docker**
Use `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for self-contained deployment.

#### **Monitoring and Logging**
* **Sentry**: Error tracking.
* **Vercel Analytics**: User metrics.
* **Supabase Logs**: Database and Auth.

#### **Deployment Checklist**
- [ ] Tests pass locally.
- [ ] Build successful.
- [ ] Environment variables in production.
- [ ] Migrations applied.
- [ ] Smoke tests in production.
