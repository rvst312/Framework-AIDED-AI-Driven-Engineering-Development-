### **PHASE 4: UX/UI Design with AI**

**Objective**: Create professional and functional visual designs using AI tools and optimized flows.

#### **Assisted Design Process**

    Step1[1. Research] --> Step2[2. Prompt Design]
    Step2 --> Step3[3. AI Generation (v0/Stitch)]
    Step3 --> Step4[4. Figma (HTML to Design)]
    Step4 --> Step5[5. Documentation]
    Step5 --> Step6[6. Dev Ready]

    style Step6 fill:#b2dfdb,stroke:#00796b,stroke-width:2px
```

**Step 1: Research and References**
1. **Inspiration Search**: Dribbble, Behance, Mobbin.
2. **Mood Board Creation**: Compile visual references, color schemes, and patterns.

**Step 2: Design Prompt Generation**
Request a detailed prompt from ChatGPT including visual style, palette, typography, and components, based on Phase 0 context.

**Step 3: Design Generation with v0/Stitch**
1. Create project in v0.dev or Stitch.
2. Use generated prompt and iterate (Generation → Review → Adjustments).
3. Generate variants and responsive design (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).

**Step 4: Export and Conversion to Figma**
1. Export HTML/CSS code.
2. Use "HTML to Design" plugin in Figma.
3. Organize in Figma (Design System, Screens, Flows).
4. Create Design System (Components, Variants, Auto-layout).

**Step 5: Design Documentation**
In ClickUp: Link to Figma, Style Guide, Component Specs, and flows.

**Step 6: Preparation for Development**
1. Activate **Dev Mode** in Figma.
2. Export assets (SVG, WebP).
3. Document responsive specifications and interactive states.

#### **Alternative Tools**
* **v0.dev**: React/Next.js Components.
* **Stitch by OpenAI**: Full layouts.
* **Uizard**: Sketches to design.
* **Figma AI**: Native tools.
