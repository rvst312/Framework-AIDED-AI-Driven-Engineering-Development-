# AIDED Methodology

## The Idea Behind AIDED

AIDED (AI-Driven Engineering & Development) was born from the need to organically and structurally integrate Generative Artificial Intelligence into the software development lifecycle. It's not just about using AI tools as code assistants, but rethinking how we conceive, design, and build software when we have intelligent agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks at our disposal.

The methodology seeks to empower human capabilities by eliminating friction in repetitive and error-prone tasks, allowing developers to focus on high-level architecture, complex business logic, and innovation.

## Creator

This methodology was conceived and developed by **Aaron Franco**.

## Open Source and Continuous Improvement

AIDED is an **Open Source** project. We firmly believe in the power of the community to evolve and perfect the tools we use.

The vision is that this framework is not static. The idea is to constantly improve it with community contributions, adapting it to the new capabilities of AI models emerging every day, and refining processes to make software development more efficient, robust, and enjoyable.

We invite you to contribute, suggest improvements, and be part of the evolution of AIDED!
