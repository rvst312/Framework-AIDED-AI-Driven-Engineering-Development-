## **Fundamental Principles**

1. **Context over Code**: Development quality directly depends on the quality of the context provided to the AI.
2. **Living Documentation**: Documentation evolves along with the project and serves as the source of truth.
3. **Incremental Iteration**: Progressive development based on complete user flows.
4. **Total Traceability**: Every architectural and functional decision must be documented and accessible.
5. **Separation of Responsibilities**: Specialized AI agents for different aspects of development.
